### -Minimum Wage Confounding Variables & Tradeoffs [a list in progress]
---

**Question:** *Are there downsides to increasing the legally required minimum wage that outweigh apparent benefits?*

**Omissions:** Below are a mix of tradeoffs and statistical issues in observing the effects of a mandated wage increase that differs from strictly market-clearing raises.

---

1) **Business Cycle:** Increases in the minimum wage are often done after a recession. This conceals negative costs because the economy is already destined to improve as time goes on. Cities with an already booming economy can greatly conceal negative costs as well (Seattle during it's $15/hr phase in is a good example).

&nbsp;

2) **Total Hours Worked:** A minimum wage increase has no benefit for the workers it's intended to help if they lose a corresponding number of hours through shifts that are reduced in length or availability.

&nbsp;

3) **Who is Employed:** The workers who are most negatively impacted by the minimum wage are *uncredentialed workers with little to no work history.* An aggregate employment rate by itself fails to distinguish a negative impact in employment for this group.

&nbsp;

4) **Non-Salary Benefits:** Anything from tips, bonuses, shift flexibility, or other various workplace benefits not necessarily tied to hourly salary can decrease and offset any mandated wage increases. 

&nbsp;

5) **Price Increases/Supply Reductions:** The cost of goods and services in an area with a mandated wage increase can (and often does) go up to pay for the new labor costs, and/or the amount of those same things you can get for the same price may drop (e.g. portion sizes at restaurants).

&nbsp;

6) **Effect on Smaller Firms:** Mandated wage increases can lead to the closure of "mom and pop" stores, yet show no major employment effects because those workers are now forced to work for major chain stores. This can be especially pronounced on cities with a higher number of locally-owned family businesses.

&nbsp;

7) **Mobility Reduction:** The ease of rising into a higher-paying occupation may decrease due to a higher minimum wage. Why this is the case is multi-faceted: 

* If the pay for jobs beyond entry-level are reduced to make up for minimum wage increases (what economists call "wage compression"), then minimum wage workers may soon find themselves competing with higher skilled workers. The skilled workers may find that an easier job that now pays more due to a wage increase is a worthy tradeoff.
* If the pay for higher skilled jobs goes down to make up for mandated wage increases, then moving up from entry-level jobs to more challenging occupations may no longer be seen as a worthy tradeoff for entry-level workers. Combining this with the other facet of wage compression mentioned above could mean a lower-paying economy overall.
* Welfare "cliffs" may also become more apparent for workers under minimum wage increases.

&nbsp;

8) **Inflation/Deflation Factor:** An increase in the minimum wage may have no measurably negative impact, yet have no positive effect if the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased. This can be especially relevant if the wage increase is passed after a recession, and Federal Reserve interest rates are artificially low.

&nbsp;

9) **Spillover Between Cities:** Workers who are more willing to commute or move between cities (and have a more established work history) may take advantage of a minimum wage increase in a city at the expense of entry-level workers who already live there. Those other workers may be forced to look elsewhere for a job. If this takes place, the net benefit for workers in general could be nothing or even negative even though employment statistics for cities may remain unchanged.

&nbsp;

10) **New Costs in Getting Work:** It may take far more time to find a job, and added requirements may be needed to get hired. Examples include a need for new credentials, volunteer service, or internship, etc. This is especially an issue for people who had no job to start with.

&nbsp;

11) **Aggregates/Base Rate Fallacy:** Some studies will look at Federal or State increases in the minimum wage without seeing how much (if at all) they differ from more local legal municipalities. It's meaningless to talk about an increase from $8-$10/hr if a more local area already had the latter amount as a legal wage floor. Many studies also will claim that massive *percentage* increases have been shown to have no negative impact without disclosing what the base rates (absolute dollar amounts) were.

&nbsp;

12) **Ignore Effects Accross Time:** Perhaps the most fundamental error (and somewhat related to #1) is to avoid looking at the combined impact of all these factors across time, and to rely on phased in increases that make it harder to see what that impact really is.
