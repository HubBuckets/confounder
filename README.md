# Confounder - draft 1.0

### *(Semi) Automating methodological reviews of causal research*

&nbsp;

*I am working on this under the tentative hope that it will serve as a capstone for a data science immersive course. But more importantly, this is something I've hoped to make for several years - long before I knew what data science even was.*

Confounder is a proof-of-concept in unstructured data analysis. This tool will pre-screen text samples to determine if certain methodological errors have been made - specifically in articles or studies which claim that one variable (**X**) influences another (**Y**). It is operationally similar to a spam filter in the sense that it can be trained to categorize text by certain features. In this case, the goal is not to sort spam from valid emails, but rather to pre-screen news articles, blog posts, or studies for reliability on a causual topics ("X leads to Y").

**Please note that this is not "fact-checking" software and no such thing can exist (see final paragraph); it merely screens content to determine if it is even worth your time.**

Analysis on a topic is more *reliable* if it **accurately measures** *manipulated* as well as *responding* variables, accounts for a *greater number* of significant **controlled variables**, and also makes a careful effort to find the **causal order** between both variables - *ruling out that "Y" is actually what causes "X."*

![Research Methodology Criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analyticascent/confounder/master/Research%20Methodology.png)

The three methodological issues refered to above will be called **measurement,** **confounding,** and **time series errors** throughout this readme. For the most part, checking for missing variables in news articles or blog posts will be the easiest implementation of this tool. As for advanced use, this project is particularly focused on semi-automating a *meta-analysis* of existing causal research on a topic - one that attempts to sort what studies accurately accounted for which of the three issues.

**Aggregation** and **sampling issues** (quantity and systematic error) could in theory also be checked for, but it must be stressed that the magnitude of such flaws are more open to interpretation than the three methodological issues pictured above. Whether a study falls prey to the [Yule-Simpson effect](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125970744553071829) or some form of [ecological fallacy](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/fallacy.php) is likely too much of a second-order problem that can't easily be deduced from word patterns alone. Sampling quantities are often explicitly stated (often in the absract), but deducing sampling bias may also be too hard to infer using natural language processing alone.

## Where the Name Came From

[**Confounders**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) could be described as being additional variables that may distort the true causal relationship between causal and responding variables. As a simple example, consider a claim that [ice cream consumption leads to higher crime rates](http://icbseverywhere.com/blog/2014/10/the-logic-of-causal-conclusions/). The confounder (missing variable) in this case is the season (summer). People spend more time outdoors (and thus availability for crime rises) during the summer *and* they tend to consume more cold goods - for rather obvious reasons.

Accurate studies require that as many statistically significant confounders are accounted for, otherwise the claim that "**X** causes **y**" could be false. Many things must be taking into account before causality can be inferred but the project is titled **Confounder** because checking for missing variables is the easiest (and often most crucial) step in making accurate inferences.

&nbsp;

## The Concept in Theory

*Conceptually* this project follows the following procedural steps for any given topic of research:

* List all potential confounders that should have been controlled for in a study or article making a causal claim
* Determine what keywords or raw text patterns are associated with accounting for those confounders (or failing to)
* Write scripts which will check for the absense or presence of those phrases and/or text patterns in passages

Right now, testing is under way with the use of an IPython notebook that converts sample studies into document-term matrices which are then analyzed by a multinomial naive Bayes classifier in Scikit-Learn. Studies featured in a meta-analysis on a given topic will be used as a train/test set.

![Document-Term Matrix](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/static/research/nmf_cluster1.PNG)

The operating assumption boils down to this: *Good studies will have term frequencies that are distinct from bad ones.* Any studies featured in a meta-analysis that described what the study did or did not account for can easily be used to train a classifier. If academic studies on a topic that... 

* Do not effectively establish a statistical association between hypothesized independent and responding variables
* Fail to account for all statistically significant confounders - or control variables of any kind
* Do not accurately distinguish the order of causation between the two variables (conflating cause and effect)

...are lexically distinct enough from studies on the same topic that *do* manage to meet the three criteria, then there is no reason a machine learning program cannot be trained with sample studies to identify flawed studies from robust ones. How true this turns out to be may depend on the topic in question in addition to how authors of a study choose to write about it.

&nbsp;

## The Process in Practice

The phases of execution would play out as follows:

* All implementations will start with the criteria mentioned previously (measurement, confounding, causal order)
* For an particular research area, a specific criteria will be established that stems from those three things
* A representative sample set will then be needed of studies that meet or fail those criteria in various ways
* Using that sample set, a variant of Confounder will be trained to recognize which studies fail what criteria
* Finally, the previous three steps will be reiterated to keep boosting accuracy with more and varied samples

Any outcome of the scripts can be challenged by critiquing the threshold for accurate measurement (e.g. the accuracy or lake thereof for various proxies turns out to be different), what control variables should be used (some were left out, or ones used don't have the impact that was originally claimed), as well how time series analysis should be carried out (better data becomes available, among other things).

&nbsp;

## Applications for Economic, Scientific, or Sociological Research

Unstructured data analysis could be used to identify word patterns that indicate whether a variable in a study has been accounted for. From there various forms of text analysis can be used to infer if those adjustments have been made. It may be possible to check for common signs of unreliable research using certain phrases as features for machine learning.

## In Summary: clarifying relevant procedural steps

So how exactly would a working version of this get put to use? Below are ten steps that must be executed for reliable results. The first five involve gathering the training data for the supervised machine learning program put to use in the second five steps. 

&nbsp;

 **1.** *Decide on an area of causal research (does X cause y?)*

 **2.** *Determine how X and y are measured in existing studies*

 **3.** *If proxies of any kind are used, determine accuracy*

 **4.** *List all statistically significant control variables*
 
 **5.** *Determine how causal order of variables may be sorted*
 
 --
 
 **6.** *Gather as much research articles related to #1 above*
 
 **7.** *Find which studies meet the* **measurement** *criteria*
 
 **8.** *Find which studies controlled for what* **confounders**
 
 **9.** *Find which studies performed* **time-series analyses**
 
 **10.** *Autosummarize results as a generated meta-analysis*
 
 &nbsp;
 
 Steps #1-5 are predominantly a *human* workload, while #6-10 in theory can be done through *classifiers* as part of a *supervised machine learning* program. The training data could be studies from an existing meta-analysis (which may already have done the first five steps to a degree). This could then be used to train various classifiers to take in any *new* studies and see whether they meet the methodological criteria stressed above. 
 
#### Bear in mind that there is no realistic way a program can ever do all ten steps by hand (let alone act as "factchecking" software). Anyone who claims otherwise is either trying to peddle hype, or maybe just has a shallow understanding of deep learning. One analogy used by [Hilary Mason (former chief data scientist at Bitly)](http://www.pcmaconvene.org/features/the-mindset-you-need-to-develop-according-to-data-expert-hilary-mason/) is that machine learning programs can tell you whether A or B is correct, but not what those two should be in the first place (using an A/B test as an example). Software will forever be limited in answering second-order questions as well.
